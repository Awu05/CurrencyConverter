# CurrencyConverter

A simple currency converter that queries data from fixer.io to get the currency exchange rates from. 
Rates are from the European Central Bank and are updated daily at 4pm CET.

The app uses coreData to store currencies that you want to track. Currently, the tracked currencies will only update when you open the app.

# Future Functions
In a future update, I want to implement a currency range alert that will alert you when an exchange rate hits a certain range that you set.
